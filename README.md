# Technical Assessment - SQL with Sakila Database

Welcome to my technical assessment on SQL. This assessment aims to demonstrate my understanding and skills in SQL using the Sakila database, an example database that simulates a movie rental store.

## Description of the Sakila Database
The Sakila database contains tables that represent different aspects of a movie rental store, including:

**film:** Information about the movies.

**actor:** Information about the actors.

**customer:** Information about the customers.

**rental:** Information about the rentals.

**category:** Information about the movie categories.

**inventory:** Information about the movie inventory.

These tables contain relevant data that can be used to perform queries and analysis within the context of a movie rental store.

## Evaluation Criteria
During this assessment, I will be evaluated on the following aspects:

### Basic Queries:
- SELECT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- INSERT

### Grouping and Filtering Functions:
- GROUP BY
- WHERE
- HAVING

### Use of Joins:
- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- RIGHT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN
- UNION
- UNION ALL

### Subqueries:
- Simple subqueries
- Correlated subqueries

### CTE (Common Table Expressions):
Using CTEs to simplify complex queries.

I hope this assessment demonstrates my proficiency in SQL.
